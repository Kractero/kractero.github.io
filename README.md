A personal website for my NationStates only GitHub account, because why not. Built with Astro, as I've used it on my actual portfolio. Idea was inspired from [Pronoun](https://github.com/esfalsa/esfalsa.github.io). Design took inspiration from [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) and [lee robinson](https://leerob.io/).
